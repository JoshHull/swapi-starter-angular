# SwapiApp

## Instructions For the Interview Exercise

We are hoping to get a little peek into your creative thinking and problem solving, with a side effect of you getting to show off your technical skills with Angular, CSS and Typescript. 

We want to see something that will utilize the data at the Star Wars API - https://swapi.co. In this starter app, we've created a starting point.  It leaves a lot to be desired. You'll spend your time making the app more interesting, and user friendly. 

Clearly you don't have enough time to get fancy or detailed, so just do your best to get something working that will show off your ideas. Let the creative solution take front stage. Don't worry too much about making the code pretty, or organized properly.  

After the exercise, we will join you for a short demo, and then we'll collectively brainstorm to come up with something to add to it together. 

Here is a backlog of issues. In addition fixing any of these, come up with at least one thing that you come up (something not on this list) that might make the app more interesting: 

  ```
  1. There are only a few hints. That's not very interesting. 
  2. The list of people matching the hints keeps getting bigger.  That's not right.  
  3. The hints don't make sense...
  4. The flow of the game isn't good.  It should have a fail point, a win condition, and also a way to start the game over.
  5. After I guess a character, they're still in the list of options to guess!
  6. I don't remember who I guessed already.
  ```

## Technical Details

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.  You will need NPM and Angular CLI installed in order run the commands listed here. 

These things will be set up on the computer we give you for this exersize. 

## Starting the App within a Development Container

#### First install all of the dependencies with `npm`
```
npm install
```

#### Then run one of these two options: 
```
npm start
ng serve 
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

You can add components, or other Angular objects using cli commands. This is helpful, because it injects almost all of the neccessary entries into your Module, and adds the code to the appropriate place in the file system so that you can reference the new element in other parts of your application. 

#### For example, to add a component run this command: 
  ```
  ng generate component component-name
  ``` 
  
#### Here are more commands for things you might want to generate:  
  ```ng generate directive directive-name
  ng generate pipe pipe-name
  ng generate service service-name
  ng generate class class-name
  ng generate module module-name
  ```
