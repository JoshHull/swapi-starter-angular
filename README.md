# SwapiApp

## Instructions For the Interview Exercise

We are hoping to get a little peek into your creative thinking and problem solving, with a side effect of you getting to show off your technical skills with Angular, CSS and Typescript. 

Do your best in one hour to create the most beatiful, interesting star wars universe travel guide of all times. You should gather some information on some of the user's likes and dislikes and recommend a planet to visit on vacation. 

We want to see something that will utilize the data at the Star Wars API - https://swapi.co in order to create a single page app that will show off your idea.  In this starter app, we've baked in some calls to the swapi.co endpoints, but you'll have to figure out how to make the data interesting and useful for your solution. 

Clearly you don't have enough time to get fancy or detailed, so just do your best to get something working that will show off your main idea. Let the creative solution take front stage. Don't worry too much about making the code pretty, or organized properly.  

After the exercise, we will join you for a short demo, and then we'll collectively brainstorm to come up with something to add to it together. 

## Requirements

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.  You will need NPM and Angular CLI installed in order run the commands listed here. 

These things will be set up on the computer we give you for this exersize. 

## Starting the App within a Development Container

#### First install all of the dependencies with `npm`
```
npm install
```

#### Then run one of these two options: 
```
npm start
ng serve 
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

You can add components, or other Angular objects using cli commands. This is helpful, because it injects almost all of the neccessary entries into your Module, and adds the code to the appropriate place in the file system so that you can reference the new element in other parts of your application. 

#### For example, to add a component run this command: 
  ```
  ng generate component component-name
  ``` 
  
#### Here are more commands for things you might want to generate:  
  ```ng generate directive directive-name
  ng generate pipe pipe-name
  ng generate service service-name
  ng generate class class-name
  ng generate module module-name
  ```
